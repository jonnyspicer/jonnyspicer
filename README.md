## Hi, I'm Jonny ✌

- I use he/him pronouns
- I like post-punk 🎸, Mexican food 🌮, and climbing 🧗‍♂️
- I don't like cats 🐈, country music 🪕 and over-used references to The Shining 🔪
- I mostly use C#, although occasionally I dabble in Python
- At the moment I'm working on [Boudica, a C# chess engine ♟,](/jonnyspicer/boudica) and writing in my [🖋 blog](https://jonnyspicer.com) every day. I also try and do some fun stuff using my blog posts as a dataset
- You can follow me on [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/jjspicer) connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonnyspicer/) or [check out my website](https://jonnyspicer.com)
