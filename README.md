## Hi, I'm Jonny ✌

- I use he/him pronouns
- I like post-punk 🎸, Mexican food 🌮, and climbing 🧗‍♂️
- I don't like cats 🐈, country music 🪕 and over-used references to The Shining 🔪
- I'm currently trying my best to learn Go, and I have previous experience with C#, JavaScript & a smidge of Python
- At the moment I'm working on some very simply Go programs [like Tac-Tac-Go ⭕❌,](https://github.com/jonnyspicer/tic-tac-go) and writing in my [🖋 blog](https://jonnyspicer.com) every day
- I've also been messing around with GPT, using my blog posts as a dataset
- You can follow me on [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/jjspicer) connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonnyspicer/) or [check out my website](https://jonnyspicer.com)
- Or if you fancy it, [you can challenge me to a game of chess ♟](https://www.chess.com/member/jspicer)
